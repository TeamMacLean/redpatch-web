        <p class="title is-4">Why does it take so long to process my images?</p>
        <p>Redpatch needs to go through every pixel of your image. The bigger the image you upload the longer it takes. There isnâ€™t a significant accuracy increase as the image size goes over about 2 Megapixels. Try reducing the size of your images if you want redpatch to work faster</p>
